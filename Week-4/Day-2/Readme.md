## ðŸ˜‰ Pokemon Classification Project 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify Pokemon images into three categories: Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and Charmander. By training a deep learning model on a labeled dataset of Pokemon images, the system can predict the correct category for a given input image.

### âž¤ Project Overview
* The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing and classifying PokÃ©mon images into three categories: Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and Charmander.
*  We will utilize a deep neural network architecture, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to learn and extract relevant features from PokÃ©mon images.
*The model will be trained on a carefully curated dataset consisting of labeled images of Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and Charmander, ensuring a diverse range of poses, angles, and environments.
* Data augmentation techniques, such as image rotation, flipping, and zooming, will be applied to enhance the model's ability to generalize and handle variations in the input data.
* The model's performance will be evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, to assess its classification capabilities.
