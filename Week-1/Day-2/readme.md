# Linear Regression
Linear regression is a widely used statistical modeling technique for predicting or estimating a continuous outcome variable based on one or more input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.

In linear regression, the goal is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual values of the target variable.

Formula for Linear regression:

### $y=b0++ b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bn*xn$

where:

* y is the predicted value of the target variable.
* b0 is the intercept term, representing the predicted value of y when all input features are zero. 
* b1, b2, ..., bn are the coefficients or slopes of the respective input features (x1, x2, ..., xn). These coefficients represent the change in the predicted value of y for a unit change in the corresponding input feature.
* x1, x2, ..., xn are the input features or independent variables.

## The key concepts and steps involved in linear regression are as follows:

1. Data Representation: The training data consists of pairs of input features and corresponding output values. Each data instance includes one or more input variables (features) and a continuous output variable. 

2. Model Representation: In linear regression, the relationship between the input features and the output variable is represented by a linear equation of the form: Y = b0 + b1X1 + b2X2 + ... + bn*Xn, where Y is the predicted output value, b0 is the intercept (bias), b1, b2, ..., bn are the coefficients (weights), and X1, X2, ..., Xn are the input features.

3. Training the Model: The linear regression model is trained by estimating the coefficients that minimize the difference between the predicted output values and the actual output values in the training data. This process typically involves minimizing a cost or loss function, such as the mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE).

4. Gradient Descent: Gradient descent is often used as an optimization algorithm to iteratively update the coefficients of the linear equation based on the gradients of the cost function. It aims to find the optimal values of the coefficients that minimize the error.

5. Model Evaluation: Once the linear regression model is trained, it is evaluated using separate test data to assess its performance and generalization ability. Common evaluation metrics for linear regression include mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared.

6. Prediction: After satisfactory evaluation, the trained linear regression model can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. Given the input features, the model calculates the predicted output value based on the learned coefficients.
