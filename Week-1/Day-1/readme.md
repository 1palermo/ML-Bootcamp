# What is Artificial Intelligence? 
AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a field of computer science that focuses on creating machines or computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It involves developing computer programs or algorithms that enable machines to learn from data, make decisions, solve problems, and mimic human thought processes.

Within the broader field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), two prominent subfields are Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). These subfields focus on developing algorithms and models that enable machines to learn from data and make intelligent decisions.

## Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is concerned with the development of algorithms that can automatically learn patterns and relationships from data, without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms are designed to analyze large datasets and identify meaningful patterns or correlations, which can then be used to make predictions or take actions.

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model with labeled data to predict or classify new instances.
The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the correct output label for new, unseen input data.
### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning aims to find patterns or structures in unlabeled data.
The main objective is to discover meaningful insights or organize the data in a way that reveals its underlying structure.

## Deep learning
Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that focuses on artificial neural networks, particularly deep neural networks. DL algorithms are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, using interconnected layers of artificial neurons to process and learn from data.Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have set new benchmarks in performance and have contributed to significant advancements in AI applications.
